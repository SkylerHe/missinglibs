# Missing Libraries in Executable Files

This project aims to identify missing libraries in executable files and dynamically update a database with the results. It is composed of two main parts:

1. **Main Pipeline (`missinglibs.py`)**: This script serves as the core pipeline of the project. It scans executable files, detects missing libraries, and updates the database with this information.
2. **Database Schema (`missinglibs.sql`)**: This file contains the schema for the SQLite database used to store the results. It defines the structure of the database, including tables and relationships necessary to track the missing libraries information.

By separating the project into these components, we achieve a modular and maintainable design that efficiently handles the dynamic discovery and recording of missing libraries in executable files.
